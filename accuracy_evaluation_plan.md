# PICBASIC to Modern Code Conversion Accuracy Evaluation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a structured approach to evaluate the accuracy of various AI models in converting PICBASIC code to modern languages like Python and C++. The evaluation will be quantitative (with a 0-100 score) and qualitative (with specific code quality comments).

## Source Code

Two PICBASIC examples are being used as test cases:

1. Order Entry System (`PicBasic-Example1-OrderEntry.txt`)
2. Hangman Game (`PicBasic-Example2-HangmanGame.txt`)

## AI Models to Evaluate

- ChatGPT (OpenAI)
- Claude-3.7-sonnet (Anthropic)
- Gemini (Google)
- DeepSeek
- Other models as needed

## Evaluation Metrics (0-100 scale)

### 1. Functional Accuracy (40 points)

- **Core Logic Implementation** (20 points): How accurately the core business logic is preserved
- **Control Flow Preservation** (10 points): Accuracy of if-then-else structures, loops, subroutines
- **Data Operations** (10 points): Accuracy of read/write operations, data manipulation

### 2. Structural Adaptation (30 points)

- **Language Paradigm Adaptation** (15 points): How well PICBASIC concepts are translated to object-oriented or structured programming
- **Modern Programming Practices** (10 points): Use of appropriate data structures, functions, modules
- **Error Handling** (5 points): Implementation of appropriate error handling mechanisms

### 3. Code Quality (20 points)

- **Readability** (5 points): Code clarity, meaningful variable names, comments
- **Maintainability** (5 points): Code organization, modularity
- **Efficiency** (5 points): Appropriate algorithms and data structures
- **Documentation** (5 points): Docstrings, comments explaining complex logic

### 4. Additional Features (10 points)

- **Enhanced Functionality** (5 points): Sensible enhancements beyond direct translation
- **Modernization** (5 points): Use of language-specific features that improve the original code

## Evaluation Process

1. **Setup**

   - Gather all AI-converted code files in their respective folders
   - Ensure each conversion has a clear label indicating which AI model produced it

2. **For Each Source File**

   - Review the original PICBASIC code to understand its purpose and functionality
   - Examine each AI conversion systematically using the metrics above

3. **For Each AI Model**

   - Assess each metric category independently
   - Record scores and specific comments for improvement
   - Calculate the total accuracy score (0-100)

4. **Comparative Analysis**
   - Compare performance across AI models for each example
   - Identify patterns of strengths and weaknesses by model

## Evaluation Sheet Format

Create a `accuracy_results.md` file with a table structured as follows:

| AI Model | Source File | Functional Accuracy | Structural Adaptation | Code Quality | Additional Features | Total Score | Comments |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------- | --------------------- | ------------ | ------------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| ChatGPT  | Order Entry |                     |                       |              |                     |             |          |
| ChatGPT  | Hangman     |                     |                       |              |                     |             |          |
| Claude   | Order Entry |                     |                       |              |                     |             |          |
| Claude   | Hangman     |                     |                       |              |                     |             |          |
| Gemini   | Order Entry |                     |                       |              |                     |             |          |
| ...      | ...         |                     |                       |              |                     |             |          |

## Detailed Review Process

For each AI model and source file:

1. **Read the original PICBASIC code** completely
2. **Read the converted code** to get a general understanding
3. **Trace execution paths** through both versions to compare logic flow
4. **Test scenarios** if possible to verify correct behavior
5. **Evaluate each metric** and assign a score
6. **Add detailed comments** about strengths and weaknesses
7. **Calculate the total score**

## Sample Detailed Evaluation Template

For each AI model and source file combination, create a detailed evaluation that looks like:
